- name: synscan.c - a simple TCP SYN Scanner for Linux
  description: |
    This simple port scanner emits TCP SYN datagrams and waits for replies.
    If a TCP SYN/ACK datagram is received, the port is considered as open. If
    either a TCP RST datagram is received or a timeout elapses, the port is
    considered as closed. There can be multiple outstanding SYN packets
    travelling around, i.e. the tool doesn't wait for one packet to return until
    the next one is sent. The number of parallel packets can be defined by a
    preprocessor constant.

    Usage: synscan [-h] [-n] [-p port(s)] <source> <destination>

    -h      Print help and exit
    -n      Do not resolve port names in report
    -p      Ports to scan (single port or range in format 'a-b')

    Destination can be an IP address or a hostname. Source address must be the
    IP address of the interface from which the packets are sent. If no ports
    are specified the well-known ports from 1-1023 are scanned.
