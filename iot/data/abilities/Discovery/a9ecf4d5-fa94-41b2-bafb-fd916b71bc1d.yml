  description: 'This simple port scanner emits TCP SYN datagrams and waits for replies.

    If a TCP SYN/ACK datagram is received, the port is considered as open. If

    either a TCP RST datagram is received or a timeout elapses, the port is

    considered as closed. There can be multiple outstanding SYN packets

    travelling around, i.e. the tool doesn''t wait for one packet to return until

    the next one is sent. The number of parallel packets can be defined by a

    preprocessor constant.
