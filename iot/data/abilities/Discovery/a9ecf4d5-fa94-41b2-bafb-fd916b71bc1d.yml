  name: Busy-Botnet - TCP SYN Scanner
  description: |
    This simple port scanner emits TCP SYN datagrams and waits for replies.
    If a TCP SYN/ACK datagram is received, the port is considered as open. If
    either a TCP RST datagram is received or a timeout elapses, the port is
    considered as closed. There can be multiple outstanding SYN packets
    travelling around, i.e. the tool doesn't wait for one packet to return until
    the next one is sent.
